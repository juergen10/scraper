        "content": "<div class=\"job-desc\"><h4>Latar Belakang:</h4><p>INVEST DM 2.0 adalah program yang didanai oleh USAID dan dilaksanakan oleh Mercy Corps, bekerja sama dengan BNPB untuk mendukung BNPB dalam memperkuat peran, fungsi, dan tanggung jawabnya untuk mengisi kesenjangan di bidang-bidang prioritas. Bidang-bidang dukungan meliputi penguatan kapasitas teknis dalam persiapan darurat, respons, dan pemulihan; perencanaan dan pengembangan kebijakan; tata kelola/lembaga; dan pengembangan organisasi. Semua ini berpusat pada satu aspek: pengembangan sumber daya manusia. Tujuan utama dari Program INVEST DM 2.0 adalah memperkuat kapasitas lembaga penanggulangan bencana di Indonesia dan sumber daya manusia pada berbagai tingkat administrasi agar mereka dapat memenuhi mandat dalam menyediakan layanan penanggulangan bencana yang efektif dan menyelamatkan nyawa.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sebagai upaya untuk memetakan kapasitas Sumber Daya Manusia (SDM) yang dimiliki saat ini, BNPB telah melakukan penilaian potensi, asesmen kompetensi manajerial dan sosial kultural terhadap 666 staf yang terdiri dari pejabat fungsional tingkat pertama, muda dan madya; pejabat struktural eselon 4 dan eselon 3 serta staf pelaksana. BNPB telah menggunakan hasil dari pemetaan kapasitas SDM dalam membangun Manajemen Talenta untuk mewujudkan rencana suksesi <em>(succession planning)</em> \u00a0yang objektif, terencana, terbuka, tepat waktu dan akuntabel sehingga dapat memperkuat dan mempercepat penerapan Sistem Merit di organisasi BNPB. Hasil pemetaan dikelompokkan ke dalam 9 kotak manajemen talenta <em>(talent pool)</em> untuk menentukan talenta yang masuk ke dalam kelompok rencana suksesi dan rekomendasi tindak lanjut. BNPB telah memanfaatkan talent pool sebagai rekomendasi bagi tim Badan Pertimbangan Jabatan dan Kepangkatan (Baperjakat) dalam menentukan promosi dan mutasi bagi para pejabat struktural eselon 4 dan eselon 3. Membangun manajemen talenta merupakan suatu proses dalam membangun manajemen SDM berbasis kompetensi.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Dalam rangka membangun perencanaan dan pengembangan SDM, BNPB telah menyusun perencanaan dan pengembangan SDM <em>(Human Capital Development Plan \u2013 HCDP)</em> 2020-2024 yang berfungsi sebagai peta jalan bagi BNPB dalam merencanakan dan membangun kapasitas SDM setiap tahun baik melalui jalur pendidikan formal maupun pendidikan non-formal.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Untuk melihat sejauh mana sistem manajemen SDM berbasis kompetensi serta HCDP diterapkan di organisasi BNPB dan kebutuhan pengembangan SDM kedepan, sebuah review terhadap praktek dan kebijakan SDM akan dilakukan dalam rangka meningkatkan kinerja organisasi.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h4>Tujuan / Deskripsi Proyek:</h4><p>Tujuan dari kegiatan review ini adalah untuk memahami sejauh mana manajemen SDM ASN, termasuk HCDP, telah diimplementasikan oleh BNPB, keberhasilan dan tantangan yang dihadapi serta kebutuhan untuk pengelolaan sumberdaya manusia yang efektif kedepan.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Review diharapkan mencakup semua aspek manajemen SDM ASN sebagaimana diamanatkan dalam Undang-Undang nomor 20 tahun 2023 tentang Aparatur Sipil Negara yaitu: (a) Perencanaan Kebutuhan; (b) Pengadaan; (c) Penguatan budaya kerja dan citra institusi; (d) Pengelolaan kinerja; (e) Pengembangan talenta dan karir; (f) Pengembangan kompetensi; (g) Pemberian penghargaan dan pengakuan; dan (h) Pemberhentian.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Biro SDM dan Umum BNPB telah mengembangkan Sistem Manajemen Sumber Daya Manusia berbasis kompetensi <em>(Competency-Based Human Capital Management System)</em>, yang meliputi antara lain pengelolaan kinerja, pengembangan talenta dan karir serta pengembangan kompetensi. BNPB juga telah menyusun <em>Human Capital Development Plan 2020-2024</em> (Perencanaan dan Pengembangan SDM 2020-2024).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Dalam rangka memetakan kapasitas SDM yang ada saat ini, BNPB telah melakukan penilaian potensi, asesmen kompetensi manajerial dan social kultural terhadap 666 pegawai. Disamping itu, BNPB juga telah memiliki pedoman mengenai Manajemen Talenta. Selain itu, BNPB juga telah berhasil membangun sistem aplikasi manajemen talenta, yaitu <em>e-talent pool</em>. Sistem ini digunakan untuk menyimpan data hasil asesmen para pegawai dan mengkategorikannya ke dalam 9 box. Hasil asesmen yang telah dikategorikan ini telah dimanfaatkan oleh Badan Pertimbangan Jabatan dan Kepangkatan (Baperjakat) sebagai pertimbangan dalam melengkapi persyaratan yang telah ditetapkan pada waktu melaksanakan promosi dan mutasi untuk mengisi jabatan struktural eselon 3 dan 4. Disamping itu, BNPB juga telah menggunakan sistem aplikasi <em>e-kinerja</em> yang telah dibangun oleh BKN. Setiap ASN wajib untuk mengisi Sasaran Kinerja Pegawai (SKP) dengan menggunakan sistem aplikasi ini untuk kemudian SKP tersebut disampaikan dan direview oleh atasan masing-masing guna diberi penilaian. Data hasil penilaian kinerja individu akan tersimpan di dalam sistem aplikasi e-kinerja yang terhubung antara BKN dengan masing-masing Kementerian/Lembaga Negara.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Review/evaluasi ini akan mengidentifikasi status/penerapan manajemen sumber daya manusia berbasis kompetensi di BNPB berdasarkan peraturan/standar pemerintah, kesenjangan, kebutuhan dan peluang untuk membangun manajemen sumber daya manusia yang sistematik dan berkelanjutan di BNPB. Review/evaluasi akan menjawab pertanyaan kunci, antara lain:</p><ol><li>Sejauh mana BNPB telah menerapkan aspek-aspek manajemen sumber daya manusia berbasis kompetensi berdasarkan undang-undang nomor 20 tahun 2023 tentang Aparatur Sipil Negara.</li><li>Bagaimana pengelolaan kinerja pegawai ASN BNPB dilaksanakan untuk pencapaian tujuan dan sasaran organisasi.</li><li>Bagaimana pengembangan talenta dan karir pegawai ASN BNPB dilaksanakan berdasarkan Sistem Merit</li><li>Bagaimana pengembangan kompetensi pegawai ASN di BNPB dilaksanakan melalui pembelajaran secara terus menerus <em>(lifelong learning)</em> agar tetap relevan dengan tuntutan organisasi</li><li>Human Capital Development Plan (HCDP):</li></ol><ul><li>Sudah sejauh mana implementasi HCDP di BNPB dan apa kendalanya.</li><li>Apakah HCDP yang sudah dimiliki oleh BNPB saat ini masih relevan dengan kondisi SDM yang ada di BNPB saat ini terkait dengan adanya program penyederhanaan birokrasi dimana beberapa Kedeputian sudah tidak ada lagi pejabat struktural eselon 3 dan eselon 4 akan digantikan dengan jabatan fungsional.</li></ul><ol start=\"6\"><li><em>Individual Development Plan</em> (Rencana Pengembangan Individu/Staf)</li></ol><ul><li>Apakah para pimpinan dan bawahan dari setiap unit kerja di BNPB telah memahami dengan baik mengenai pentingnya penyusunan Individual Development Plan?</li><li>Bagaimana proses penyusunan Individual Development Plan di BNPB?</li><li>Apa saja kendala yang dihadapi dalam proses penyusunan Individual Development Plan di BNPB?</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><ol start=\"7\"><li>Apakah kebutuhan-kebutuhan untuk implementasi manajemen SDM ASN terakomodir dalam Renstra BNPB 2020-2024, pencapaiannya dan tantangan, serta kebutuhan yang perlu dimasukkan kedalam Renstra berikutnya.</li></ol><p>\u00a0</p><ol start=\"8\"><li>Keberfungsian Sistem Informasi Manajemen Kepegawaian (SIMPEG)</li></ol><p>\u00a0</p><p>Review/Evaluasi akan dilakukan secara kualitatif melalui desk review, wawancara, dan FGD, dengan konsultasi dan juga secara kuantitatif melalui survei.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Hasil review/evaluasi ini akan dalam bentuk laporan dan pemaparan (slide-deck) yang akan disampaikan kepada para pengambil keputusan di BNPB.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h4>Kegiatan Konsultan:</h4><p>Konsultan yang terpilih untuk tugas ini akan, di bawah arahan INVEST DM 2.0, melakukan aktivitas berikut ini:</p><ul><li>Mengembangkan metode review/evaluasi dan rencana kerja</li><li>Melakukan review/evaluasi berdasarkan metodologi dan rencana kerja yang disepakati.</li><li>Melakukan serangkaian diskusi dengan unit-unit kerja terkait di BNPB terutama dengan Biro SDMU dan Pusdiklat dalam hal proses implementasi manajemen SDM ASN serta pengembangan staf di BNPB.</li><li>Menyusun laporan hasil review/evaluasi dan slide deck dengan bahasa dan isi yang mudah dipahami oleh pengambil kebijakan, yang menjawab pertanyaan-pertanyaan review/evaluasi diatas dan rekomendasi.

On behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the program promotes the sustainability of selected agricultural supply chains in partner countries.</p><p>Agricultural commodities like coffee, cocoa, natural rubber, palm oil, or soybean play an important role in rural development in many developing and emerging countries \u2013 where they form the basis for the life of millions of households. However, their production and processing are accompanied by numerous ecological, economic, and social challenges. Often supplied as unprocessed raw material into global supply chains, limited value is added in producing countries. Many farming households are struggling to meet their basic needs, let alone to invest in sustainable production practices. Furthermore, coffee, cocoa, palm oil, and soybean are often perceived as drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. With consuming markets and multi-national companies strengthening their efforts to eliminate deforestation and human rights abuses from their supply chains, the sustainability of raw materials is increasingly becoming a precondition for market access.</p><p>To address these challenges the program implements the project \u201cSustainability and Value Added in Agricultural Supply Chains in Indonesia\u201d (SASCI+). SASCI+ focuses on natural rubber, palm oil, cocoa, and coffee in two biosphere reserves in West Kalimantan and Central Sulawesi. By increasing the sustainable production of agricultural commodities and strengthening downstream processing and market linkages, the project aims to increase the farmers\u2019 incomes, safeguard natural resources, and establish deforestation-free supply chains. SASCI+ follows a jurisdictional approach to align relevant stakeholders on shared objectives for sustainable production as a means for long-term market access and security of supply.</p><p>SASCI+ is implemented together with the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, as the political partner of the project, and in close collaboration with the bilateral GIZ portfolio on agriculture and forestry. The project furthermore cooperates with the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment and Forestry, regional and district governments in the targeted biosphere reserves, as well as stakeholders from civil society, research, and the private sector involved in sustainable agricultural supply chains.</p><p>The project is recruiting a Junior Advisor on Sustainable Palm Oil to support project implementation in Sanggau District, West Kalimantan.</p><p>To support the project, we seek one (1) motivated and qualified Indonesian candidate for: <strong>Junior Advisor on Sustainable Oil Palm </strong><strong>(Job Title in SAP: Agriculture Junior Advisor)</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Advise partners from the public and private sectors on sustainability and value-added in the palm oil supply chain.</li><li>Support the strategic and operational planning of activities in Sanggau.</li><li>Support and ensure assisted cooperatives meet ISPO and RSPO sustainability standards</li><li>Supporting assisted cooperatives in increasing sales of Fresh Fruit Bunches that meet fruit quality criteria to Palm Oil Mills</li><li>Coordinate and support the implementation of activities in Sanggau.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Tasks</strong></p><p><strong>1.
